/**
 * Ensoniq ES5503, the Apple IIGS's DOC: thirty two oscillators on the PCM rows.
 * <p>
 * An oscillator steps a wave table by its frequency register, so that register is the playback
 * ratio and the key is the note it comes nearest. How big a step it is, though, is not fixed: the
 * oscillator's {@linkplain #step resolution and table size} scale it, and taking it against one
 * rate for every oscillator - which is what this did - put every note far below the bottom of the
 * scale, where the key column has nothing to show and stayed blank for the whole song.
 * <p>
 * The control register halts an oscillator with its bit 0 and picks an output channel in its high
 * nibble - the display has no room for eight outputs, so that becomes a left or right lean.
 * <p>
 * Thirty two oscillators do not fit nine rows, so they are taken in the order they first sound.
