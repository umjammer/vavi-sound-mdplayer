/**
 * The shape the Amiga trackers share: a handful of voices, each with a note taken straight from
 * the pattern, a volume the envelope has worked on, and on HVL a pan.
 * <p>
 * These drivers render their own audio and register no chip, so there are no registers to read -
 * the replayer's voices are the state. The note is a tracker note number rather than a frequency,
 * which is what a tracker means by a key anyway.
