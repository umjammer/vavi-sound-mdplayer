/**
 * The CS4231 codec of an X68000 Mercury unit, which MUAP plays its PCM through: one row, and what
 * is on it is the sound itself.
 * <p>
 * There is nothing else to read. A codec has no channels, no notes and no level registers - the
 * driver hands it a stream and it plays it - so where every other reader here decodes registers,
 * this one meters the output the emulator reports and leaves the key and the note length alone.
 * A song played entirely this way (MUAP's {@code INIT.O} is one) lit nothing at all before, and a
 * display with every row dark says the music has stopped.
