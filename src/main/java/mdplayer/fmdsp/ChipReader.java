/**
 * What every reader of a real chip shares: where the chip is, and which of it this reader shows.
 * <p>
 * A VGM may declare two of most chips - a Sega System 18 board is two YM3438s, and both of them
 * play - so {@code ChipFmDspSource} builds a second reader of every kind and points it at chip 1
 * with {@link #chipId(int)}. Everything a subclass reads out of {@link ChipRegister} is then read
 * at {@link #chipId} rather than at 0, and the second reader stays {@linkplain #ready not ready},
 * costing nothing, for the songs that declare one chip.
 * <p>
 * Readers whose state lives on a driver rather than on a chip - the trackers, the MIDI one - keep
 * implementing {@link FmDspChipReader} directly; there is nothing of theirs to double.
