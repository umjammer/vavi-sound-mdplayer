/**
 * The shape nearly every sampled chip here has: some number of channels on the PCM rows, each with
 * a playing flag, a volume, a pan and a rate, read out of the chip's own {@code getInfo}.
 * <p>
 * A subclass says where the chip is and how to read one channel out of the map. What it gets in
 * return is the row claiming - chips with more channels than there are rows hand them out in the
 * order they first sound - and the key on edges, found by watching the playing flag rather than
 * trusting a key on bit that stays set long after the sound has gone.
