/**
 * Capcom Q-Sound: sixteen sampled channels on the PCM rows.
 * <p>
 * The DSP keeps everything in its register file. The rate is a 12 bit phase increment, so
 * {@code 0x1000} plays a sample at the chip's own rate and the key is the note that ratio comes
 * nearest, ratio 1.0 being o4 c. The pan is an index into the chip's own mixing tables.
 * <p>
 * Two emulators answer for this chip and a song picks one of them; both report the same fields.
 * <p>
 * Sixteen channels do not fit nine rows, so they are taken in the order they first sound.
