/**
 * The MIDI drivers - RCP, RCS, MID and ZMS - which emulate no chip at all.
 * <p>
 * There is nothing to read back: the notes go out to a synthesizer that reports nothing, so what
 * is shown is what went past {@link MidiPlugin} on its way there. A MIDI note is already a note,
 * so these keys are exact; the volume is the note's velocity scaled by the channel's controller 7
 * and its expression, and the pan is controller 10.
 * <p>
 * Sixteen channels do not fit nine rows, so they are taken in the order they first sound. The
 * spectrum is not limited that way - see {@link #readFft}.

     * envelope kept every one of them sounding at full level for the rest of the song - ten drum
     * bands stacked across the axis, which is the display filled to the ceiling and holding still.
     * A key that decays on its own falls out of the picture whether the song releases it or not,
     * and a drum {@linkplain #DRUM_TAU dies away} faster than a note does, the way a hit does.
     * <p>
