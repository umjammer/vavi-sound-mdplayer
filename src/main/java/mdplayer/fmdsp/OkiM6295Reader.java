/**
 * OKI MSM6295: four ADPCM voices on the PCM rows.
 * <p>
 * A voice carries a volume, taken from the four bit attenuation its key on command names, and
 * nothing else of its own - the chip has one rate for all four, divided from its clock by the pin 7
 * state. So the key here is the same on every row and moves only when the clock or that pin does,
 * which is the truth about this chip rather than a shortcoming of the reading.
 * <p>
 * Whether a voice is sounding is the emulator's own {@code playing}, which clears itself when the
 * sample runs out. The chip does publish key on edges, but reading them takes them, and the panel
 * reads them too - so the edges here are found by watching {@code playing} instead.
 * <p>
 * The chip is mono.
