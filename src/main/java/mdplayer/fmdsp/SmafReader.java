/**
 * SMAF, which is played by a real MA-2/3/5 player on an emulated PC and emulates no chip here.
 * <p>
 * There is nothing to read back and, unlike the MIDI drivers, nothing even goes past on its way
 * out: the Yamaha dll inside the emulated PC is handed the file and sequences it itself. So what
 * is shown is the score the player wrote out before it started - see {@link SmafTelemetry} - read
 * against the audio it has since produced. A SMAF note is a MIDI note with the length it is held
 * for written next to it, so these keys are exact and their rows let go on their own.
 * <p>
 * Sixteen channels do not fit nine rows, so they are taken in the order they first sound, the way
 * {@link MidiReader} does. The analyzer bars are not this reader's business: SMAF audio is
 * rendered through mdplayer's own mixer, so they are measured off the sound itself.
