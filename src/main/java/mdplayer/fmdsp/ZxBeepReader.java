/**
 * The ZX Spectrum's beeper, on one SSG row: the one voice here that is watched rather than read.
 * <p>
 * Every other chip is asked what it is playing. This one cannot be - a beeper is a single bit the
 * CPU flips, with no note register, no level and no key - and a {@code .ay} whose music is all
 * beeper (ProjectAY's demo tunes are) left every row, meter and bar of the display empty while it
 * played. What can be seen is that the speaker is moving, and that is what the row says.
 * <p>
 * Not what note it is playing, though the flips are counted and it is tempting: the beeper engines
 * that play two and three parts at once do it by interleaving short pulses, and their speaker runs
 * at twenty kilohertz whatever the tune - {@code Beeper Demo part 3} measures 19.5 kHz through a
 * melody in the middle of the keyboard. Half the flips per second is the pitch of a plain square
 * wave and of nothing else, so the row is marked {@link TrackInfo#STREAM} and the keyboard is left
 * alone. Pulling the parts back out of a one bit stream is the driver's knowledge, not the
 * speaker's.
