/**
 * FMP7, which plays on an emulated PC and emulates no chip here.
 * <p>
 * Nothing goes past on its way out either - FMP7 synthesizes its own OPNA and hands the result
 * to a sound card - so there are no registers to read back. What there is instead is better:
 * FMP7 publishes what its driver is doing, part by part, as it does it, and that is the note the
 * MML asked for rather than a frequency worked back out of a divider. See {@link Fmp7Work}.
 * <p>
 * A part says which of the three kinds it is - FM, SSG, PCM - and those are the three row groups,
 * so the rows line up with the driver's own parts. Which sound source each one went to (an OPNA,
 * an OPM, the rhythm generator) is in the work too, and is what names the chip over the meters.
 * The analyzer bars are not this reader's business: FMP7's audio goes through mdplayer's mixer,
 * so they are measured off the sound itself.
