/**
 * Feeds {@link FmDspVisualizer} from the shared chip register caches, independent of the sound
 * driver playing.
 * <p>
 * Every driver funnels its chip writes through the {@link ChipRegister} chip wrappers, which cache
 * the register file and the key-on state. This source polls those caches through the
 * {@link FmDspChipReader}s found by {@link ServiceLoader} - it names no chip and no driver, so it
 * works for any format mdplayer plays. Subscribe {@link #update(GenericEvent)} to the audio event
 * stream: the "master" event carries the rendered PCM, which clocks the ~120 Hz snapshot and feeds
 * the spectrum.
 * <p>
 * The fmdsp rows are grouped ({@linkplain Group#FM FM}, {@linkplain Group#SSG SSG},
 * {@linkplain Group#PCM PCM}, the {@linkplain Group#RHYTHM drum meter}) and each group's rows are
 * assigned to the readers that report activity, in the order they become active - whatever chips a
 * song actually plays claim the screen. Compared to a driver-specific source
 * ({@link mdplayer.driver.pmd.PmdFmDspSource}, {@link mdplayer.driver.fmp.FmpFmDspSource}) three
 * things are approximations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the MML columns, which belong to a driver's work area and are measured off the chip here
 * instead: the key and the detune are decoded from the frequency registers rather than read as the
 * driver's note and detune, the note length and the gate are timed between key ons and key offs
 * rather than read as the note's own, and of the "M:" flags only the two the registers can answer
 * are filled - see {@link #statusOf}. The tone number is whatever the chip calls one, and a chip
 * with no instruments has none.</li>
 * <li>the level meters, which are synthesized from the level registers and a decay envelope
 * retriggered on every key-on edge, exactly like the driver-specific sources do.</li>
 * <li>key-on edges. The caches are polled, so a channel retriggered with the very same register
 * state between two snapshots is missed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Pre-timed streams such as VGM never program TimerB; the tick counter - and with it the clock and
 * the circle animation - would freeze, so it falls back to a synthesized {@link #defaultTimerB}
 * tempo. A driver that renders nothing at all - a MIDI one, whose sound is the synthesizer's -
 * leaves the analyzer nothing to measure, and its bars come from its notes instead: see
 * {@link #readFft}.
