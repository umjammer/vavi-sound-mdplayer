/**
 * Plays a SMAF file by running mmftoolc.exe - a real MA-2/3/5 player, built for Windows - on an
 * emulated PC, and taking what it writes to its {@code waveOut} device.
 * <p>
 * <b>What paces it.</b> The emulated player keeps time the way it would on real hardware: it
 * hands the sound card a buffer, and cannot hand it the next one until the card has played the
 * last. So the emulated card has to take its samples at the rate they are meant to be heard at,
 * no faster - which is exactly what happens when {@link #write} blocks until {@link #read} has
 * made room. Let it take them as fast as the emulator can make them and the player's own sense
 * of time goes with it: the song comes out at the wrong speed and ends in the wrong place.
 * <p>
 * The queue between the two is what makes that safe to rely on. The emulated player fills it
 * during the seconds it spends loading its instrument tables and then stays that far ahead, so a
 * moment where the emulation cannot keep up is taken out of the cushion rather than heard.
 * <p>
 * Those loading seconds are digital silence, dropped rather than queued - jdosbox drops them at
 * the emulated device now, and this drops whatever still gets through - so they cost nothing to
 * sit through. What is queued is real audio, which is the point: the cushion has to be built out
 * of the song, not out of the silence in front of it.
