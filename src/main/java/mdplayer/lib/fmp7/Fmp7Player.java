/**
 * Plays an FMP7 song by running FMP7.exe - the real thing, built for Windows - on an emulated PC,
 * and taking what it writes to its DirectSound buffer.
 * <p>
 * <b>What paces it.</b> The emulated player keeps time the way it would on real hardware: it
 * writes into a sound buffer ahead of the play cursor and cannot get further ahead than the
 * buffer is long. So the emulated card has to take its samples at the rate they are meant to be
 * heard at, no faster - which is what happens when {@link PcmQueue#write} blocks until
 * {@link #read} has made room. The cushion between the two is therefore not ours to choose: it
 * is FMP7's own sound buffer, which on this machine is 400ms. There is room for it - FMP7
 * synthesizes about four times faster than it plays here - and the queue below only has to be
 * deep enough not to be the thing in the way.
 * <p>
 * <b>What it says it is playing.</b> FMP7 is closed source, but its api is published and it
 * keeps a shared memory - {@link Fmp7Work} - up to date as it plays. On a real PC another
 * process reads that; here the other process is this jvm, which is what
 * {@link SharedMemory} is. A reading is taken every time samples are handed over and kept with
 * the position in the audio they were handed over at, so that what the visualizer shows is what
 * was playing when the sound it is drawn against was made - see {@link #workAt}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Room.</b> FMP7 needs a machine with 64MB in it. On the default 16 it starts, plays, and
 * quietly never publishes its work: the allocation in front of that fails and it carries on
 * without it.
