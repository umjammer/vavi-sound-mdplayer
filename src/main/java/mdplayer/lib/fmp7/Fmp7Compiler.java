/**
 * Compiles FMP7 MML - a ".mwi" - into the ".owi" the player reads, by running FMP7's own
 * compiler on an emulated PC.
 * <p>
 * <b>Not FMC7.exe.</b> The compiler that comes with FMP7 is a gui program and it ignores its
 * command line entirely: its startup takes the arguments and nothing ever reads them again, and
 * it compiles only from its own file dialog, from a file dropped on its window, or from one it
 * has been told to watch. None of those can be driven from outside. What can is
 * {@code fmc.dll}, the compile core underneath it, whose {@code Compile()} is published for
 * exactly this purpose - see <a href="http://fmpdoc.fmp.jp/fmc-api/">the api page</a>. So what
 * runs on the emulated PC is {@code fmc7c.exe}, forty lines of C that load that dll and call it;
 * it is built from {@code /mdplayer/lib/fmp7/fmc7c.c} beside the copy this carries, and the
 * command that builds it is at the top of that file.
 * <p>
 * <b>What it needs.</b> {@code fmc.dll} and {@code common_resrc.dll}, out of the same FMP7
 * directory {@link Fmp7Player} plays from - {@code -Dmdplayer.fmp7.path=<dir>}.
 * <p>
 * <b>What comes back.</b> The object file, or an {@link IOException} carrying what the compiler
 * said. FMC7 has moved on since most of these songs were written and is stricter than the
 * version they were compiled with - envelopes on a pcm part, for one, are an error now and were
 * not then - so a song that will not compile is not necessarily a song with anything wrong with
 * it, and saying which line it stopped at is the whole of what can be done about that.
