/**
 * What every chip panel is.
 * <p>
 * A chip panel is a skinned screen showing one chip's state: {@link #changeScreenParams()} pulls
 * that state out of the chip each frame, {@link #drawScreenParams()} blits what changed, and
 * {@link #update()} presents it. Each panel differs only in its skin, its parameters and what it
 * draws — everything else is the same, and lives here.
 *
 * @param <P> this panel's draw state (its own nested {@code Params} class), diffed new against
 *            old to decide what needs redrawing
